HCJ stand for "html css js"
this project was made in educational purposes to 
practice basics of html css js. All criticism is 
welcome! Also, I would recommend you to watch my
portfolio projects, you can find them on my main
page, then go to repo named “portfolio” and then
get familiar with my code quality and experience
